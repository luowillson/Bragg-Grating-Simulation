# Bragg-Grating-Simulation
Uses the transfer matrix method to simulate the reflectance and transmittance of a Bragg grating. The simulation can be done using index profile or width profile. Apodization as well as propagation loss are also considered. A couple other functions are also included to graph various index measurements.
